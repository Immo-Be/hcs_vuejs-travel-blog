      Welcome to my travel blog, fellow traveler!
    </h1>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 12px" class="subtitle">
      My name is Immo and I am an marketeer gone coding. This travel blog is
      part of my final project at the
      <strong>Hamburg Coding School.</strong> There is a lot to see and do so
      play around with the features

      This website is built using Vue.js as a javascript framework. It also
      takes advantage of the power of the Bulma CSS framework. The backend
      powered by node.js is hosted on heroku and is connected to a mySQL
      database. So feel free to CRUD all trips ðŸ˜‰. If you have any inquires,
      comments or just want to hire me, feel free to use the
      <strong>form below</strong> (you can literally do so, it literally works
      for real... no drill)
