      My name is Immo and I am an marketeer gone coding. This travel blog is
      part of my final project at the

      This website is built using Vue.js as a javascript framework. It also
      takes advantage of the power of the Bulma CSS framework. If you have any
      inquires, comments or just want to hire me, feel free to use the
      <strong>form below</strong> (you can literally do so, it literally works
      for real... no drill)
